# RedScare
*Weekend game creation week 1*

It's communists vs. capitalists in the fight of the century!

In this two-person game, one person becomes the red dictator, the other blue. In the finite amount of time that is your lifetime, each player much try to take as much land as possible. Player with the most red/blue land wins.
